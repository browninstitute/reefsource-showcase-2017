We believe technology empowers journalists and researchers to use the environment as a firsthand data source. Reefsource is engaging the diving community to contibute citizen science to support participatory storytelling about the environment. To do this, we are both distributing cameras, as well as soliciting for RAW photos from divers to build a crowdsourced dataset of coral reef images. When a diver uploads photos, we run the images through an algorithm to provide a rough health score. As we grow our community, the dataset grows. As the dataset grows, researchers and journalists can gain new understanding about the health of a reef.
