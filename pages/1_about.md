Open Contractors is a project dedicated to the idea that government data must not only be available to the public, it must also be accessible and understandable. It seeks to take a difficult-to-understand database of government contracts, and provide graphics, language and context to better allow journalists and non-expert level readers to see stories in this data.

Open Contractors was part of the 2015-2016 cohort of Magic Grants. Our team consists of two people, [Allison McCartney](https://twitter.com/anmccartney) and [Alexandre Gonçalves.](https://github.com/alexgonca)
