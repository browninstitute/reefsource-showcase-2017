Modern reporting is increasingly reliant on using data as source of evidence - numbers on a page can prove trends and anomalies, and add context to the anecdotes told by sources. 

Fortunately, many government agencies release their data openly on the web, but unfortunately much of this data is presented in a frustrating and byzantine manner. With the current public-facing government databases, journalists cannot quickly find, understand and verify government contractor data for the purposes of writing a story on a daily deadline. This means that these valuable databases go underused, and important stories go untold.

The problem with bad government open data portals is [well-known and documented](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/what-s-wrong-with-open-data-sites-and-how-we-can-fix-them/). In 2014 the government opened 18F, an office within the General Services Administration dedicated to improving federal digital services offerings. 

Groups of journalists, entrepreneurs and citizen activists have worked on services like [Census Reporter](https://censusreporter.org/), [Open Elections](http://www.openelections.net/) and [Citizen Audit](https://www.citizenaudit.org/) to help laypeople make their way through difficult data that the government hasn't provided proper portals to.

We wanted to continue in this effort to bring better data exploration tools to the public by tackling one of the largest and most difficult government databases of all: the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS).

Unlike some other data sets, the FPDS data does currently have a portal: [USAspending](http://usaspending.gov). USAspending allows for people to search their dataset, access an XML API and bulk download cuts of their data, but does not context or clarity for any of the information it provides, or allow easy access to downloading the data you really want. In April 2015, the site was [redesigned](https://sunlightfoundation.com/2015/04/02/redesign-is-awful-but-usaspending-still-proves-power-of-the-public/) to make it even more difficult to navigate.

We hope that this project will add to greater public understanding of how government contracting works, and allow journalists to more quickly discover stories and sources in this data.
