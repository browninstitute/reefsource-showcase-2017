In recent years, the headlines continue to be bleak: human impact and climate change is causing mass bleaching events, damaging coral reefs across the world. In 2017, the Great Barrier Reef near Australia experienced a severe bleaching event for the second consecutive year. Coral reefs are the "canary in the coal mine" for determining the health of ocean-based ecosystems and coastal areas. Not only does a quarter of the oceanâ€™s animals and plants depend on healthy reefs for food and shelter, but entire economies lean on the tourism and fishing industries reliant on thriving coral populations. The need to better understand coral reef health is more vital than ever.

Our goal is to make coral reef image collection easy and fun. We want to replace boring note-taking during dives and tedious data entry with modern image analysis.

Once we receive photos from you, we run them through our automated computational pipeline. We start by detecting corals using computer vision classification algorithms. We then analyze coral colors and produce a histogram to show the variation in the coral health.
